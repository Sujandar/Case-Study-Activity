Coinbase is a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange platform. It was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam
with the aim of creating an easy-to-use platform that would enable people to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, 
Ethereum, and others crytpcurrencies. Since then, Coinbase has grown to become one of the largest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, 
with over 68 million registered users across 100+ countries. Thier competitors include other cryptocurrency exchanges such as 
Binance, Kraken, and Gemini. In addition, traditional financial institutions such as PayPal and Square have also started offering 
cryptocurrency services, making them indirect competitors to Coinbase.
